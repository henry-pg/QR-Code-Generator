# QR-Code-Generator

Hello!

This is a very simple and minimalistic website that I made to generate QR codes based on user-inputted links. 

links to resources that were used for this project:
- https://github.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs (library that was used to generate QR codes)
- https://codepen.io/hylobates-lar/pen/qBbQeON (cool css codepen that I used to achieve the background gradient effect)
